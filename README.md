# Boolean_OR_Filter_Test
Created with CodeSandbox

- This examples uses ListJS library, with bitwise operators for the filtering function. 
- Within the Unordered List, only those elements selected via checkboxes are visible in the display.   
- Individual elements may be members of more than one "category"
- Unlike a traditional ListJS text base search, the "filter" function here acts as a Boolean OR operation, and not a Boolean AND operation.
